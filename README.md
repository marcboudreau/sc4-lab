# Runways

This project features modules for constructing 200 foot wide orthogonal runways.  The modules provide realistic markings according to the FAA, with a few exceptions listed below:

* Runway Centerline markings are only 60 feet long and spaced 40 feet apart instead of the prescribed 120 feet with 80 foot gaps.
* The Runway Centerline markings begin 70 feet past the Runway Landing Designator marking instead of the prescribed 40 feet.
    
These exceptions were made in order to provide uniform modular pieces that allow building a variety of runway configurations.

## Runway Design

The following describes how to arrange the various modular pieces to build a realistic runway.  Follow the directions to build both ends of the runway and then continue filling in either 400 foot or 100 foot Runway Section pieces until the entire runway is filled.

### Runway Threshold

Runways begin with the Runway Threshold piece.  There are two threshold pieces: one with a Threshold Bar and one without.  When either a blast pad, stopway, or displaced threshold is in place, the Runway Threshold with Threshold Bar must be used, otherwise, the Runway Threshold piece is used.

### Runway Landing Designator Marking

These consist of a 100 foot section of runway with a number ranging from 1 to 36, which corresponds to the runway approaches azimuth rounded to the nearest 10 (10 degrees to 360 degrees).  There are also 3 letter designators used on parallel runways.

When two parallel runways exist, the runway on the left (from an approach perspective) bears the designator L under its number designator.  As such, the runway on the right bears the designator R.  When there are 3 parallel runways, the left-most runway bears the designator L, the right-most runway bears the designator R, and the center runway bears the designator C.

For instructions of dealing with 4 or more parallel runways refer to the [FAA's Standards for Airport Markings](http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150_5340_1l.pdf) document, section 2.3.e(4).

#### Parallel Runways

In the case of parallel runways, the Runway Landing Designator Letter Marking piece is placed immediately after the threshold and then the Runway Landing Designation Number Marking piece is placed, followed by a single 100 foot section of runway.

#### Single Runway

In the case of a runway with no parallel runways, the Runway Landing Designator Number Marking piece is placed after the threshold and two 100 foot sections of runway follow.

### Runway Touchdown Zone Stripes

Runway Touchdown Zone Marking pieces are needed for precision approach runways.  They are used to mark the zone where aircraft should be touching down on the runway.  The markings are spaced 500 feet apart.  At a maximum there can be 6 touchdown zone markings for each approach.  However, the Runway Aiming Point always acts as the second marking.  So the progression of markings is as follows: start with a 3-stripe marking, then the aiming point marking, then 2 consecutive 2-stripe markings, and finally 2 consecutive 1-stripe markings.  However, there must never be any touchdown zone markings within 900 feet of the runway's longitudinal center.  So following the progression, as soon as a marking would be placed within 900 feet of the center, it and any remaining touchdown zone markings are omitted.

The 3-stripe, 2-stripe, and 1-stripe Runway Touchdown Zone Marking pieces are all 100 feet long, so they should be followed by 400 feet of runway using either 100 foot Runway Section pieces, or a single 400 foot Runway Section piece.  Before placing the next touchdown zone marking piece.  This will ensure that they are spaced 500 feet apart.  The Runway Aiming Point pieces is 200 feet long, so it should only be followed by 300 feet of runway.

### Runway Aiming Point

The Runway Aiming Point Marking is a predominant marking that pilots visually aim for during landing operations in conjunction with other landing aids.  Their placement was discussed above in the Runway Touchdown Zone Stripes section.  However, it should be noted that the Runway Aiming Point Markings can be moved up to Â±200 feet for a variety of reasons, including avoiding an intersecting runway.  The other Runway Touchdown Zone Markings are not adjusted whenever the Runway Aiming Point Marking is moved within such constraints.
